## Sonnet 18

> Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

Everyone knows that Shakespeare was probably talking about comparing code repositories when he wrote Sonnet 18. This is a project that's an ode to that. Compare GitHub repos for when you're not sure which one is most up-to-date, popular, or right for your needs.
